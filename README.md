## FAQs

### How to fix prettier?

Install npx and run `npx prettier@latest --write .` on the repo root.

### My `validate-entry` check keeps failing

Make sure all your entrypoints (`rpc_url`, `explorer_url`, `metrics_endpoint`) are up and working correctly.

### My `check-file-changes` check keeps failing

Make sure that you're only adding one file in your PR. This should be a .json file in the above mentioned
